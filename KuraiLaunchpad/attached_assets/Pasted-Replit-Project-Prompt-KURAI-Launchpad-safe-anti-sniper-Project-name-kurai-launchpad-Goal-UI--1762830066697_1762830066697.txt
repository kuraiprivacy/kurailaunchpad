Replit Project Prompt — KURAI Launchpad (safe, anti-sniper)

Project name: kurai-launchpad
Goal: UI + basic app flow for a Pumpfun/Solana-compatible launchpad that prevents front-running using fair-launch patterns (commit–reveal, batch auctions, LBP), with dev funds routed through escrow + timelock/multisig. The frontend uses Kurai’s dark/teal color theme.

Safety: DO NOT implement or request any code that hides or makes wallets untraceable. Dev payouts must use auditable on-chain flows (escrow, vesting, multisig/time-lock). This prompt purposefully avoids privacy-evasion details.

Tech stack (recommended)

Frontend: React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS (or plain CSS with CSS variables)

Wallet: @solana/wallet-adapter-react + Phantom adapter (mockable in Replit)

Backend (dev-replit server): Node.js + Express (for sealed-order relay, rate-limiting, and ephemeral storage)

Optional: Supabase / Postgres for order queue persistence and audit logs

On-chain contracts: placeholders for audited CommitmentRegistry, BatchAuction, EscrowVesting, LBPController (implemented off-Replit by solidity/anchor devs)

Kurai color tokens (CSS variables)

Use these in your Tailwind config or CSS:

:root{
  --kurai-deep: #1E1436;      /* deep purple */
  --kurai-mid:  #2E1B4A;      /* mid purple */
  --kurai-accent:#26E7D7;     /* neon teal */
  --kurai-accent-2:#3BE8D3;   /* cyanish */
  --kurai-pale: #BFEFF3;      /* pale glow */
  --kurai-bg:   #0F0B14;      /* near-black */
  --text-main:  #E6F9F8;
}

What the Replit app will DO (MVP)

Theme and layout matching Kurai colors + anime aesthetic hero (place character art in header).

Wallet connect UI (Phantom adapter) — clearly labelled and mockable in Replit.

Create launch form with safe options:

Launch mode: Batch auction / LBP / Dutch / Bonding curve (UI only; hook for on-chain later)

Developer allocation & vesting schedule (defaults to on-chain vesting with timelock)

Option: require multisig or community sign-off to release dev funds

Commit–reveal flow UI: show how creators submit a commitment (hash) and later reveal — the frontend generates the commitment and stores it locally or submits to a sealed relay (server) — placeholder for on-chain submission.

Sealed order batch UI: traders submit sealed orders to an off-chain relay (server) during a window; server publishes a merkle root or encrypted bundle to on-chain at settlement time. This removes mempool visibility of individual orders. (High-level flow only — actual on-chain settlement requires an audited contract.)

Escrow & vesting dashboard: show funds flow into escrow, vesting schedule visualization, and release milestones; all movements are auditable in the UI with tx links (once integrated).

Audit log: Simple UI table that records events (commitments, reveals, batch settlements, escrow releases) and links to transaction hashes (or placeholders).

Basic anti-bot measures: client + server rate limits, captcha placeholder, and nonce-based signer check UI.

Starter UI copy & components (what to implement now)

Header

Logo (KURAI mark), tagline: “KURAI — fair launches, ghostly UX.”

Connect Wallet button (shows connected pubkey).

Create Launch (CreateLaunchForm.jsx)

Fields: name, symbol, total supply, launch type (select), commit-reveal toggle, dev allocation + vesting (days/weeks), escrow multisig address.

Preview Parameters button: shows a hashed commitment preview (SHA256 of parameters).

Commit–Reveal Panel (CommitRevealFlow.jsx)

Commit button: generates commitment (hash) and optionally POSTs to /api/commitments (sealed relay).

Reveal button: allows reveal after reveal window—sends reveal to on-chain contract (placeholder function).

Batch Auction (BatchAuction.jsx)

Submit Sealed Order form: amount, maxPrice, signature. Submits to /api/orders (server saves sealed order). Shows order status as sealed.

Settle Batch (creator action): triggers a settleBatch() placeholder that calls on-chain contract to process sealed orders and add liquidity.

Escrow Dashboard (EscrowDashboard.jsx)

Shows escrow balance, vesting timeline, multisig signers, and proposeRelease() placeholder.

AuditLog (AuditLog.jsx)

Chronological events, searchable, with tx links.

Minimal server (server.js) responsibilities

/api/commitments — store commitment entries (timestamped). (In Replit, store in-memory or file for demo.)

/api/orders — accept sealed order bundles and store them securely until settlement window ends.

Rate limiting middleware; simple IP + address throttle.

Endpoint to export audit log (CSV) for transparency.

Important: Server stores sealed orders only to enable fair-batch settlement. The server must be run by a trusted relayer and ideally backed by a verifiable log (merkle root) and an external auditor. Do not use server as a way to hide funds or ownership.

UI theme & example Tailwind snippet

If using Tailwind, add these CSS variables in globals.css and map them to Tailwind theme colors:

body { background: linear-gradient(180deg, var(--kurai-bg), #06040a); color: var(--text-main); font-family: Inter, system-ui; }
.header { background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(30,20,54,0.8), rgba(46,27,74,0.8)); border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(38,231,215,0.08); }
.button-primary { background: linear-gradient(90deg, var(--kurai-accent), var(--kurai-accent-2)); color: var(--kurai-deep); padding: .6rem 1.2rem; border-radius: 12px; font-weight:600;}
.card { background: rgba(20,14,30,0.6); border: 1px solid rgba(38,231,215,0.06); box-shadow: 0 6px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.6); border-radius: 16px; padding: 1rem; }

Example placeholder functions (frontend)

Add safe placeholder functions so the UI compiles and shows flows (no blockchain secrets):

// utils/launchUtils.js
import crypto from 'crypto';
export function makeCommitment(params){ // params: JSON
  const payload = JSON.stringify(params);
  return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(payload).digest('hex');
}
export async function submitCommitmentToRelay(commitHash){ 
  return fetch('/api/commitments', {method:'POST', body: JSON.stringify({commitHash}), headers:{'Content-Type':'application/json'}});
}

README / dev instructions for Replit

Create a new Replit project (Node + Vite/React).

Paste file structure above. Add package.json dev deps and run npm install.

Add sample Kurai artwork (public/kurai-hero.png) and attribution.

Run npm run dev (Vite) and npm run start-server in parallel (or use Replit's multi-process config).

Open the UI, test commit and sealed-order flows (they are mocked against the local Express server).

Next on-chain step (after audit): implement Anchor / Solana programs for CommitmentRegistry, BatchSettlement, and EscrowVesting. Hire an auditor before mainnet deploy.
